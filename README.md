# Computational_Astro

This repository contains my relevant projects from Astro 406: Computational Astrophysics at the University of Michigan, with Prof. Oleg Gnedin. The projects include:

* Advanced regression - forward, reverse, and orthogonal fitting of a straight line to log(M_halo) vs. log(M_GC) using log-likelihood maximization techniques. I also include bootstrapping methods to calculate parameter distributions, with numerical convergence.
* Markov Chain Monte Carlo - employed MCMC methods with Bayesian statistics to reproduce target and distribution parameters. Included are estimation of autocorrelation times, kernel density estimation (KDE), and experimentation with noise terms.
* Gaussian Mixture Modeling - used the transformation method to generate a random variable mock data set from a given distribution function and modeled it using GMM, using BIC and AIC to determine the optimal number of modes for reconstruction.
* Machine Learning (supervised) - classified the blue and red clumps of galaxies on color vs. magnitude, surface brightness, specific star-formation rate, and age diagrams. Models used include k Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (rbf), and Random Forest.
